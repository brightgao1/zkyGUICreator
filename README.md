zkyGUICreator is a drag-and-drop visual editor, allowing effortless creation of zky GUIs (navigation bars, buttons, textboxes, etc).

### Development
The development of this entire project was recorded (very boring and slow development tho): https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTXlpPBKroE3kEuuYOQocdgSc8XQgqaFl

This was developed in my IDE (BrightEditor), written in [the zky programming language](https://github.com/brightgao1/zky), & compiled w/ zkyCompiler, which I integrated into my IDE.
